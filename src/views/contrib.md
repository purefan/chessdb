# Views
Views are implemented in mithril.js
This is a single page app, meaning that we will not use modal views as in the original attempt. That should also simplify the architecture
although I very much liked the Proxy solution.

This way of working makes the templating easier, for example we no longer require to build an index.html file, it doesn't ever change.
